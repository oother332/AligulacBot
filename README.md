This is a personal project using the Discord4J library and the aligulac.com API to make a bot which responds to some simple queries.


## Commands

!player [player_name]
-use this to query some information about a single player

!players [player_name_1] ... [player_name_n]
-use this to query multiple players at once

!h2h [player_name] [player_name] [best_of_n]
-use this to get a prediction on which player would win in a best of n series

Additional commands are planned.
